'''This script will first split your dataset into training and testing sets using sklearn's train_test_split function.
It will then use the SMOTE class from the imblearn library to oversample the training data. Then it will initialize a
RandomForestClassifier object from sklearn.ensemble and fit it to the oversampled data. The model will then make predictions 
on the test set, and the accuracy of the model will be determined using sklearn'saccuracy_score function.
Note that you can pass additional parameters to the RandomForestClassifier object to configure the model such as n_estimators,
criterion, max_depth etc.'''
