'''This script will first split your dataset into training and testing sets using sklearn's train_test_split function.
It will then use the SMOTE class from the imblearn library to oversample the training data. 
The oversampled data will be used to train the model. 
The model will then make predictions on the test set, and the accuracy of the model will be determined 
using sklearn's accuracy_score function.'''
